A game of OceanTreasures


Instructions:

Welcome to the Ocean treasures game. The objective of the game is to use your sonar devices to discover buried treasure in the ocean. The ocean is represented as a 60 by 15 grid which has x (59 units) and y(14 units) coordinates. The treasure chests are in random locations across the ocean. You can drop one of your 20 sonar devices at a time into the ocean, which will reveal the distance you are from the nearest\n treasure chest. If a number is displayed on the location you dropped your device, this means you are x units away from the chest on the x axis.However if the letters a,b,c,d,e are displayed this means you are 1,2,3,4,5 units away respectively on the y axis from the nearest chest. If a O is displayed this means the sonar device did not pick up any buried treasure nearby. If you drop a sonar at the exact location of the treasure chest a symbol X will appear signalling you found a chest. You have only have 20 sonar devices to find all 3 buried treasure chests. Use them wisely!')
